# Advent of code 2022

This repo is here to group all my developments to answer the advent of code challenge.

The main progamming language may change during the process to learn some language.

My main programming languages are C# and F#.

## Development process

- The code should have tests
- The tests must pass
- A github action will build and run test before a pull request on main branch
